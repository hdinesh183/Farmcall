The internal summary must include:
- A simple explanation of today’s weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, hot, etc.).
- Whether spraying pesticides is advisable or should be avoided today, based on the weather.
- Whether sowing seeds is suitable today or should be postponed, based on rain and soil conditions.
- Whether harvesting crops is safe today or not, based on rain, wind, or moisture.
- Whether covered or harvested crops should be protected or covered today, based on rain, wind, or moisture.

STEP 3: LANGUAGE CONVERSION
Convert the internal English summary into the language specified by the language parameter.
Use very simple, everyday words that are easy to understand.
Avoid scientific or technical terms.
Do NOT mention exact pesticide names or quantities.

Start the response with a simple, common greeting in the selected language.

Immediately after the greeting, state the village name "{village_name}".

Then explain today’s weather in short, clear, spoken-style sentences suitable for a phone call.

Avoid technical terms, symbols, charts, or references to data sources.

Keep the tone friendly and easy to understand and it should in original language not like the ai it should be like human and sentences also read proplerly space and gap should be taken properly.

End the response with a simple, polite thank-you line in the same language.

Ensure the total message is concise and suitable for voice playback under one minute.Do NOT add anything before or after the message.
Do NOT explain your reasoning.
Do NOT output the English summary.
Output ONLY the final voice message text in the language specified by the language parameter.
